# CRM-For-Result-Tracking-Of-A-Candidate-With-Internal-Marks

### CRM system for Result Tracking of Candidates with Internal Marks has been successfully developed with a user-centric approach. The system empowers the administrator to create and manage essential base data, such as Semesters, Candidates, Courses, and Lecturers, ensuring a well-organized foundation. Lecturers are granted the capability to input Internal Results for candidates, streamlining the result recording process. Importantly, the Dean, who is also a Lecturer, holds exclusive authority to update Internal Results after re-evaluation, initiated by the Candidates. This feature ensures accuracy and fairness in the evaluation process. Moreover, candidates have the freedom to request re-evaluation for any Internal Results, enabling them to seek improvement when necessary. With its user-friendly interface, robust data security measures, and efficient result tracking capabilities, the CRM system stands as a valuable tool for optimizing academic result management within the educational institution.
